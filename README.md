### Glad to see you here! 
I am a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning 🤖. 

I enjoy building projects that combine theory with practice — from fundamental neural networks to more advanced applications like natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems. 🚀 

I love exploring how algorithms can solve real-world problems, experimenting with different models, and constantly learning new techniques to improve my skills. Beyond AI, I’m also curious about software engineering, statistics and applied mathematics, always striving to expand my knowledge and apply it creatively. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading tech articles, playing tennis, or relaxing by watching videos and series. 🌟

😅 A thing I really hate? Not understanding — it keeps me digging until I do! 🔎
